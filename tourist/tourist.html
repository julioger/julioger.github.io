                <h2><br>These are some worthy place to visit for a tourist and a college student such as me. The 
                    first image is <span>Dufan</span> and the second one is <span>Ancol</span>. <span>Dufan</span> is more of a Playground Rides type of place
                    because there are so many rides to ride there and even though it was built a long time ago, the hype still holds up until now.
                    <span>Ancol</span> is a place near the beachside of Jakarta, so if you're looking for a tan in sunny weather you could go to Ancol and the place is also near Dufan.
                    The third place is PIK "Pantai Indah Kapuk" or Kapuk Beach is also a place near the beachside of Jakarta and the place is also really beautiful.
